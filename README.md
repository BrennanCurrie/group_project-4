goal:

Our mission is to develop an effective CNN model to predict an animal's/pet's facial expression depicted within the photograph. We are striving for a model to produce an accuracy score exceeding 75%. We ran our data through various models (Sequencial, VGG16, ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet) and deployed the most successful model.
